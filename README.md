# E05b-Physics

main1 simply simulates some gravity with the balls. The gravity scaler is something I chose at random. 
The balls should spawn randomly on the screen, fall towards the bottom, and then stop.

main2 is this, but the balls now bounce off of the edge of the screen. There is a friction force
in place, so the bounces should be less and less every time, eventually stopping at the bottom.

main3 consists of 5 sprites, each given a random spawn, velocity, and mass. They bounce off of the edges of the screen, and 
when they collide with one another, their momentum swaps. This means their velocty could end up being faster or slower, but it
will change when it collides with another sprite.
